In this project, we aimed to visualize the 20 newsgroups dataset using t-SNE, a dimensionality reduction technique, to uncover underlying patterns and relationships within the data. Our approach began with meticulous data preprocessing, including text cleaning, stop word removal, and stemming/lemmatization, ensuring the data was in a suitable format for analysis.

Subsequently, we transformed the text data into numerical vectors and applied t-SNE to reduce its dimensionality while preserving its local structure. This facilitated the creation of visualizations, where we color-coded data points according to predefined groupings within the dataset.

By examining the resulting clusters and patterns, we gained valuable insights into the distribution and relationships among different groups, providing a deeper understanding of the dataset's content and structure. This project not only showcases the power of t-SNE for visualizing high-dimensional data but also highlights the importance of thoughtful preprocessing in preparing data for analysis.
